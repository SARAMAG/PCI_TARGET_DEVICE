# PCI_TARGET_DEVICE


In this project, we designed PCI slave or Target that communicates with PCI Master and 2 SRAM agents as a slave for it. 
Here the master is our testbench and the target supports these Features and Command:
 Memory Read.
 Memory Write. 
 Memory Read Multiple.
 Memory Read Line.
 Support Memory Space Decoding. 
 Support Target Initiated Termination. 
 Support Parity generation and checking from the side of the Target device.
 Support PCI 32-bit and 64-bit.  

 





THIS IS THE documentation of the PCI I worken on with my team, Here you can find our FSM that is customized for this project
